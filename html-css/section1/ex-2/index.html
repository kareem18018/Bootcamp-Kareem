<p>The viewport meta tag added to the Futuristic Tech Conference webpage is essential for optimizing the viewing experience of conference attendees on both desktop and mobile devices. By specifying "width=device-width" and "initial-scale=1.0," it ensures that the website adapts to the screen size and resolution of the user's device. This means that whether attendees are accessing the conference details and schedule on a large desktop monitor or a smaller mobile screen, the content will be displayed proportionally and responsively. It eliminates the need for excessive zooming or horizontal scrolling, making it convenient for users to access and navigate the conference information effortlessly. In essence, the viewport meta tag enhances accessibility and usability, offering a consistent and user-friendly experience for all attendees, regardless of their chosen device, ultimately contributing to a successful and inclusive tech conference</p>
