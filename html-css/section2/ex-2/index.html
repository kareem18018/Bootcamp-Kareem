    <h1>Character Encodings</h1>

    <p>Character encodings are a fundamental concept in web development and text processing. They define how characters are represented in binary form. Different character encodings serve various purposes and support different sets of characters. Some common character encodings include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>UTF-8:</strong> A widely used character encoding that supports a broad range of characters, including those from different languages and symbols. It is the default encoding for most web content.</li>
        <li><strong>UTF-16:</strong> Another Unicode encoding that uses 16 bits per character, capable of representing a more extensive set of characters. It's commonly used for data exchange and storage.</li>
        <li><strong>ISO-8859-1:</strong> Also known as Latin-1, it primarily covers characters from Western European languages. It's an older encoding that doesn't support a wide range of characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Windows-1252:</strong> Another encoding for Western European languages, often used on Windows platforms.</li>
    </ul>
