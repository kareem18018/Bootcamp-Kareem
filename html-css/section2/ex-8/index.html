        <h1>The OSI Model</h1>
        <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or networking system. It is divided into seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks.</p>

        <h2>Layer 1: Physical Layer</h2>
        <p>The Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting raw binary data over a physical medium. It deals with physical connections, voltage levels, cables, and network hardware.</p>

        <h2>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</h2>
        <p>The Data Link Layer handles data framing, error detection, and flow control. It ensures data integrity and organizes data into frames for transmission.</p>

        <h2>Layer 3: Network Layer</h2>
        <p>The Network Layer focuses on routing and forwarding data packets between devices on different networks. It also handles logical addressing and subnetting.</p>

        <h2>Layer 4: Transport Layer</h2>
        <p>The Transport Layer manages end-to-end communication, ensuring data reliability and error recovery. It includes protocols like TCP and UDP.</p>

        <h2>Layer 5: Session Layer</h2>
        <p>The Session Layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between two devices. It handles session synchronization and checkpointing.</p>

        <h2>Layer 6: Presentation Layer</h2>
        <p>The Presentation Layer deals with data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data is in a readable format for the application layer.</p>

        <h2>Layer 7: Application Layer</h2>
        <p>The Application Layer is the top layer and interacts directly with end-user applications. It provides services like email, file transfer, and network management.</p>
